        <h1>Mangu Recipe</h1>
        <img alt="mangu dish" src="images/mangu.jpg">
        <h2>A Dominican delicacy, prepared for the early mornings on the island</h2>
        <p>
            Mangu consists of 4 main ingredients: plantains, salami, eggs, and cheese. How you combine or what you 
            add to them will depend on what you personally like and the part of the country that you are from. A main addition added 
            to the plantains "the mangu" is sauteed red onions, although it is not a requirement for the dish. The salami, eggs and cheese are 
            known as the "Tres Golpes". Similarly to the onions, a person may add all or leave out ones they do not want.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 green plantains</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup of reserved water from the pot</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the plantains and cut into pieces about 1/2 inch thick. Boil in salted water for 20 minutes, until a fork 
                easily pierces the pieces.</li>
            <li>As the plantains finish cooking, reserve 1 cup of the water from the pot, then drain the rest and pour the 
                plantain pieces into a large bowl over the butter. Begin mashing, adding the 1 cup water in increments. You can add it a 
                little at a time, but remember mangu thickens as it sits so you should use the whole cup of water. Mash to the consistency you desire.
                Let sit for a few minutes before serving to allow it to “set”, season with salt. Top with pickled red onions.</li>
        </ol>
